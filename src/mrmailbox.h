 * File:    mrmailbox.h
 * Purpose: mrmailbox_t represents a single mailbox, normally, typically only
 *          one instance of this class is present.
 *          Each mailbox is linked to an IMAP/POP3 account and uses a separate
 *          SQLite database for offline functionality and for mailbox-related
 *          settings.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * NB: Objects returned by mrmailbox_t (or other classes) typically reflect
 * the state of the system when the objects are _created_ - treat them as if
 * they're strings. Eg. mrmsg_get_state() does _always_ return the state of the
 * time the objects is created.
 * If you want an _updated state_, you have to recreate the object reflecting
 * the message - or use methods that explcitly force reloading.
 *
