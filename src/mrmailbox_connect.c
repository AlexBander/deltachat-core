/**
 * Check for changes in the mailbox. mrmailbox_poll() connects, checks and disconnects
 * as fast as possible for this purpose. If there are new messages, you get them
 * as usual through the event handler given to mrmailbox_new().
 *
 * Typically the function takes less than 1 second, however, for various reasons
 * it may take much longer to connect-check-disconnect.  The caller should
 * call mrmailbox_poll() from a non-ui thread therefore.
 *
 * If there is already a permanent push connection to the server, mrmailbox_poll()
 * return 0 and does nothing (permanent push connections are started and ended with mrmailbox_connect()
 * and mrmailbox_disconnect()).
 *
 * @memberof mrmailbox_t
 *
 * @param mailbox The mailbox object.
 *
 * @return If polling was done, the function returns 1.
 *     If polling was not done, eg. on errors or if there is already a permanent connection, the function returns 0.
