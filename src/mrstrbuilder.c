 * Init a string-builder-object.

 * which is initially empty.
 *
 * You can add data to the string-buffer using eg. mrstrbuilder_cat() or
 * mrstrbuilder_catf() - the buffer is reallocated as needed.
 *
 * When you're done with string building, the ready-to-use, null-terminates
 * string can be found at mrstrbuilder_t::m_buf, you can do whatever you like
 * with this buffer, however, never forget to call free() when done.
 * 
 * @param strbuilder The object to initialze.
 *
 * @param init_bytes The number of bytes to reserve for the string. If you have an 
 *     idea about how long the resulting string will be, you can give this as a hint here;
 *     this avoids some reallocations; if the string gets longer, reallocation is done.
 *     If you do not know how larget the string will be, give 0 here.
 *
