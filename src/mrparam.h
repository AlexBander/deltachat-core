 * File:    mrparam.h
 * Purpose: Handle parameter lists as follows:
 *          - the list is stored in a string as "a=value\nb=value"
 *          - values can contain all characters but "\n"
 *          - for efficiency, keys are limited to one character
 *          - we expect the packed string to be well formatted and do not
 *            allow spaces around the key; spaces right of the value are trimmed
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * Known keys:
 * 'a' forwarded from this email-address
 * 'A' forwarded from this name
 * 'c'rypted in original/guarantee E2EE or the message is not send
 * 'v'alidation errors on decryption
 * 'f'ile
 * 'w'idth
 * 'h'eight
 * 'd'uration in milliseconds
 * 'n'ame of track
 * 'N'ame of author or artist
 * 'm'ime
 * 't'imes a job was tried
 * 'T'imes a job was tried, used for increation
 *
 * 'G'host-CC, parameter is the original msg_id
 * 'U'npromoted group
 * 'S'ystem command
 * 'E'xtra parameter for system command
 * 'P'hysically delete group after message sending
 * 'r'ead receipt wanted
 * 'R'eferences header last used for a chat
