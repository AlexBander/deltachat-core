LibreChat Backend
================================================================================

**LibreChat** is a project that aims to create a messaging app that is
completely **compatible** to the existing e-mail infrastructure.

So, with LibreChat you will get the **ease** of well-known messengers with the
**reach** of e-mail. Moreover, you'll get **indepentent** from any other
company.

Some features at a glance

- **Fast** by the use of Push-IMAP
- **Largest userbase** - receivers _not_ using LibreChat can be reached as well
- **Elegant** and **simple** user interface
- **Distributed** system
- **Trustworthy** - can even be used for business messages
- fully **OpenSource** and **Standards** based


Download
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the project is in alpha state under heavy development.  There is 
_no working prototype yet_ - only this bunch of files and the frontends as
https://github.com/r10s/messenger-android .

If you're interested in this project, you can contact me using 
_r10s at b44t dotcom_.


Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains only the messenger backend that is used by all 
frontends.

Information about how to build the frontends can be found in the corresponding
repositories as https://github.com/r10s/messenger-android .

You're a developer and have an idea for another crazy chat, social or messaging
app?  We encourage you to take this source code as a base.  We love to see 
_many_ different messengers out there, based on existing, distributed 
infrastructure.  But we hate to see the user's data hidden on some companies
servers with undefined backgrounds.
