Frequently Asked Questions
================================================================================

**To whom can I write?**

- With Delta Chat, you can write to users using Delta Chat - or any other existing
  e-mail-client.  This is one of the biggest differences to other messengers:
  There is no need for the receiver to install the same app as yours.
  
**But E-Mail ... is so slow**

- This is not true for most accounts. In fact, there are standards as Push-IMAP
  for years, that allow receiving Mails in a second or so.  

**What, if the receiver does not use Delta Chat?**

- The receiver will get a normal e-mail then - if he replies to it, you will
  see the reply in the Delta Chat app.

**Does Delta Chat support images, videos and other attachments?***

- Yes. Beside the plain text, all E-Mail-attachments are displayed as separate
  messages.  Outgoing messages will get attachments as needed automatically.

**How does Delta Chat use the E-Mail-Subject?**

- As the message content is displayed directly, the subject is not needed and will
  not be shown therefore.  For outgoing messages, the subject will be set to an
  excerpt of the message text.

**Does Delta Chat support HTML-E-Mails?**

- Yes.  If incoming E-Mail lacks a plain text part, we convert HTML-E-Mails to 
  plain text ourself.  Outgoing E-Mails always use plain text. 

**What are the advantages of Delta Chat compared to other messengers?**

- Here are a few one:
  - _Independent_ of any company or services. _You_ own your data.
  - You do not distribute your address book to anyone.
  - _Fast_ by the use of Push-IMAP
  - _Largest userbase_ - receivers _not_ using Delta Chat can be reached as well
  - _Compatible_ - not only to itself
  - _Elegant_ and _simple_ user interface
  - _Distributed_ system
  - _No Spam_ - only messages of known users are shown by default
  - _Reliable_ - safe for professional use
  - _Trustworthy_ - can even be used for business messages
  - fully _OpenSource_ and _Standards_ based

**Delta Chat - is this the final name?**

- Well, currently this is our _best_ name.  Maybe we will change it if we get
  a great idea posted to _r10s at b44t dotcom_.
