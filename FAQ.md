Frequently Asked Questions
================================================================================

**To whom can I write?**

- With LibreChat, you can write to users using LibreChat - or any other existing
  e-mail-client.  This is one of the biggest differences to other messengers:
  There is no need for the receiver to install the same app as yours.
  
**But E-Mail ... is so slow**

- This is not true for most accounts. In fact, there are standards as Push-IMAP
  for years, that allow receiving Mails in a second or so.  
  Unfortunately, many clients does not support these standards - but LibreChat 
  will.

**What, if the receiver does not use LibreChat?**

- The receiver will get a normal e-mail then - if he replies to it, you will
  see the reply in the LibreChat app.

**LibreChat - is this the final name?**

- Well, currently this is our _best_ name.  Maybe we will change it if we get
  a great idea posted to _r10s at b44t dotcom_.
